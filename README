To do:
-implement rest of play_rocket.py 
-ensure that model beats threshold for any given data set (try rawData4 next)
-collect more data ~1000 preferred
-test out behind3, behind4, different parameters for dividers

Model does not beat threshold, might retry with different parameters for dividers
Don't think I need to collect more data


Good fucking work,
check on why it always says 1.5, maybe skews x values differently
check profit of propData
write some more models with skewed x
print the x arrays as theyre going in and check it against formulated play_rocket x array

Keep checking on log variations
experiment with a probabilistic outcome for y (not categories)
Do a another run with log4_3

try unsorted
analyze 3
